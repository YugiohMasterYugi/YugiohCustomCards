In this folder are 3 items

1. Expansion
2. Unofficial Script
3. Pics

I will go over each item and how to put it in EdoPro to get your Custom cards.
I have added two Custom archetype with cards called "Zootopic" and "I.E.D" as well as some custom cards
for the archetype "Magical Musketeer".

Over the past few days I have been working on a project. This project has been hard and strenous.
I will go over the process of putting these files in. 
1. Expansion
:Right click on your EdoPro exucution file. Click on "Open file location". Move your already existing 
Expansion folder in a seperate folder on your Desktop (This is just in case you want to go back to your original EdoPro). 
Extract the expansion folder from this file if you have not already done so. Place the Expansion folder into the the 
Project Ignis folder (Note: You should already be placed into the Project Ignis folder if you followed the steps). Once you
have done so step 1 is complete.
2. Unofficial Script
:After you have placed the Expansion folder go into the folder script. These are where all the scripts are for the game. Once again
look for the folder called "Unofficial" and repeat what you did for the expansion folder. You have completed this part.
3. Pics
:Go back to your Project Ignis folder and repeat the steps you have done for Expansion and Unofficial Script. Once you are finished, you are
good to go to use these custom cards.

All custom cards below were made by "Adam Gallub":

1. All of the "Zootopic" Cards including; "Zootopic Leo", "Zootopic Phalus", "Zootopic Lupus", "Zootopic Croc", "Zootopic Ursala", "Zootopic Spirit",
 "Zootopic Aurora Borealis", "Zootopic Alpha", "Zootopic Omega", "Zootpic Evolution", "Zootopic End", "Zootopic Roar!!", "Zootopic Hunt", "Zootopic Unleashed"
, Zootopic Carnivorous Diet", "Zootopic Aftermath", and "Zootpic Token".

2. All of the "I.E.D" Cards including; "I.E.D New Beggining", "I.E.D Satosaurine", "I.E.D Veno Raptor", "I.E.D Jupitosaurus", "I.E.D Emperor Stegron",
"I.E.D Neptosaur", "I.E.D Emergence", and "I.E.D Mine Field".
3. "Magical Musketeer Otto", "Magical Musketeer Samiel", "Magical Musket - Reload", and "Magical Musket - Samiel's Will".

Other cards that "Adam Gallub" has made that have no functionality will not be discused.

I have put alot of work into this because I thought it would be cool and I hope you enjoy!! :)
